# twbot
Experimental TW Stats Plugin for [Sopel](https://sopel.chat/)

Has to be placed in ~/.sopel/modules after inital config of Sopel.  
It can be triggered by a bot admin with `.twstats #channame` or `.twdetail #channame`.
(Only works after first sub)

## Be warned! This is highly pre-alpha and has some hardwired stuff! Handle with care! (Hot potato!)
