# twbot
Experimental TW Stats Plugin for [Sopel](https://sopel.chat/)

Has to be placed in ~/.sopel/modules after inital config of Sopel.  
It can be triggered by a private message of a bot admin with `.twstats #channame` or `.twsubs #channame`.  
`twstats` gives a short info of general stats.  
`twsubs` lists all registered subs.  
(Only works after first sub)

## Be warned! This is highly pre-alpha and has some hardwired stuff! Handle with care! (Hot potato!)
